## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule and in the online campus schedule “Important Dates” section. 

This course is conducted entirely online, which means you do not have to be on campus to complete any portion of it. You will participate in the course using BC's learning management system called Canvas.

## Course Participation Policy
Participation is essential to your success in this class. In distance education courses you are required to participate just as if you were in a face-to-face course. This means that in order to get full credit for participation, you will have to complete your discussion assignments, lesson assignments and quizzes on a timely basis. Consistent failure to participate in class will result in being dropped from the course.

### Virtual Office Hours
Twice a week I will be available for virtual office hours – one morning and one evening session using Canvas Chat. Click Chat in the course navigation links.

### Netiquette
When posting on the discussion boards and chat rooms it is important to understand how to interact with
one another online, netiquette. You can read more about the rules of netiquette at
